# CCOW ContextManager

This project is fork from original [CCOW](jonathanbp/ccow.contextmanager), coffeescript has been decaffinated into ES6. 

---

This is an implementation in nodejs of a few of the interfaces in the [HL7 CCOW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCOW) specification. Its purpose is to provide a functioning (and simple) ContextManager. 

**NB:** Current status is a very rough implementation - not suitable for production.

Currently the ContextManager manages a single context and the following kind of flow is supported (CP is ContextParticipant and CM is ContextManager):


    CP ==>    JoinCommonContext(applicationName,<contextParticipant>)     ==> CM
    CP <--    OK, participantCoupon                                       <-- CM
    CP ==>    StartContextChanges(participantCoupon)                      ==> CM
    CP <--    OK, contextCoupon                                           <-- CM
    CP ==>    SetItemValues(itemNames, itemValues, contextCoupon)         ==> CM

              ...
    
    CP ==>    EndContextChanges(contextCoupon)                            ==> CM
    CP <--    noContinue, responses                                       <-- CM
    CP ==>    PublishChangesDecision(contextCoupon,decision)              ==> CM
    CP <--    listenerUrls (web-application case)                         <-- CM

              ContextChangesAccepted (CM ==> all other CPs)
   
              ...

    CP ==>    LeaveCommonContext(participantCoupon)                       ==> CM
    CP <--    OK                                                          <-- CM
